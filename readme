256 FFT IP Project

Use HLS C++

Create 256-point Radix-2 DIT FFT IP with the following parameters
FFT Size is 256
Input and Output Port using AXIS
IP has control interface using AXI-Lite for start, stop, etc
Input and Output Data is 64-bit unsigned int which is concated with 32-bit signed fixed-point real and 32-bit signed fixed-point imag
256 data which last data has tlast 1 signal are streamed into the block and then 256 data which last data has tlast 1 signal are streamed out of the block
The flow of IP is input streaming data -> bit reverse -> fft stage -> output streaming data
IP use DATAFLOW optimization
The twiddle factor is stored internal memory

Create the C++ source file
Create a test bench which simulates double-tones sine wave and checks it can be completed
Source file and test bench file can be used in Vitis HLS

Use Vitis Unified IDE 2025.1
Make Vitis HLS Project with TCL script
Make Vitis HLS Component named FFT
Top Function's name is fft
ADD Source File and Testbench File
Use xc7z020clg400-1
Input clock frequency 100 MHz
Do C simulation, C synthesis, C/RTL co-simulation, IP package
Simulate and verify the results
